# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/ivan-rom/EJ7HRNXP?sharingId=574F876E4ED933BF)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/ivan-rom/CWTQUNV9?sharingId=574F876E4ED933BF)

## Reflections

1. The first module told us about the basic concepts and knowledge about TypeScript. After this I can download TS compiler and work with it.
2. I learned about types in ts, how to use them and what they are for. But I don't really understand enum and I hope to figure it out in the future.

# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

## Reflections

1. The first module told us about the basic concepts and knowledge about TypeScript. After this I can download TS compiler and work with it.
2. I learned about types in ts, how to use them and what they are for. But I don't really understand enum and I hope to figure it out in the future.
3. In the module I've learnt about interfaces and details about work with them. Also I've seen some information about type alias but I didn't understand exactly why I have to use which option to use in what situation.
4. I learnt about types in functions and how to use them. Also I've seen interfaces and type aliases for functions, but I don't understand why I should use them or where. Because if you write a function, it means you create something that doesn't repeat. They showed me an example but I still see it strange.

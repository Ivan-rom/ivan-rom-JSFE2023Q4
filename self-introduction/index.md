Hello, my name is Ivan.
I’m a little bit bad at English so I prepared my text, I hope you don’t mind. Also I’m not good at video editing so I'm trying to record in one shot. And it's actually hard.
Let me introduce myself. I'm a junior front-end developer and I'm 19 years old. I live and study in Kyrgyzstan. Today I am a student at the Kyrgyz-Russian Academy of Education and I am a second-year student. I have been studying programming on my own for more than 4 years and during this time I have become acquainted with such technologies as: HTML, CSS, SCSS/SASS, JS, React, Redux, PHP, SQL, Python.
Let's look at each point in more detail.
I started my journey in IT by self-studying Python as preparation for college. I mastered the basics, and in general I had an idea of ​​what programming is.
Then in college I was introduced to PHP and SQL. As part of my studies there, I created small pet projects that gave me an understanding of working with databases and took me a little deeper into the backend.
But while studying in college, I realized that this was not enough for me. And then, on the recommendation of friends, I began to study the front-end, namely HTML, CSS, SCSS and JS on HTML-Academy simulators. It took me six months, and then I figured out that I liked the front end.
After the online courses, I thought it would be a good idea to do something with real people and preferably in my own city. I took a Geeks programming course, where they taught me React and Redux, and also showed me JS in more depth.
After finishing the Geeks course, I started looking for a job, which took a lot of effort and time. After some time, I found out that an Epam branch has opened in my city. I decided that this was a great opportunity to try to get a job in a cool company with the thought: Why not? This was another refusal. But to my surprise, the refusal letter came with a recommendation to take Rs School courses. and now I’m finishing Stage 1 here.
Studying here causes a lot of difficulties, especially combining it with my personal life, but it just drags me to the contrary.
